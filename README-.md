## Overview
This challenge is a simple card component challenge from FRONTEND MENTORS, a platform where frontend project designs can be gotten from and used for practice. So, basically using grid layout system I was able to achieve this project to the best of my ability at the moment.
### The challenge
-From the challenge fulfillment criteria which was made known that design must be responsive, I was able to achieve that using media query and grid, grid is a lovely. My most headache was from the least expected of placing the background image but at the end I figured it and balanced its responsiveness as well.
